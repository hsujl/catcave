      <p>Associative memory formation and recall in the adult fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is subserved by the mushroom body (MB). Upon arrival in the MB, sensory information undergoes a profound transformation. Olfactory projection neurons (PNs), the main MB input, exhibit broadly tuned, sustained, and stereotyped responses to odorants; in contrast, their postsynaptic targets in the MB, the Kenyon cells (KCs), are nonstereotyped, narrowly tuned, and only briefly responsive to odorants. Theory and experiment have suggested that this transformation is implemented by random connectivity between KCs and PNs. However, this hypothesis has been challenging to test, given the difficulty of mapping synaptic connections between large numbers of neurons to achieve a unified view of neuronal network structure. Here we used a recent whole-brain electron microscopy (EM) volume of the adult fruit fly to map large numbers of PN- to-KC connections at synaptic resolution. Comparison of the observed connectome to precisely defined null models revealed unexpected network structure, in which a subset of food-responsive PN types converge on individual downstream KCs more frequently than expected. The connectivity bias is consistent with the neurogeometry: axons of the overconvergent PNs tend to arborize near one another in the MB main calyx, making local KC dendrites more likely to receive input from those types. Computational modeling of the observed PN-to-KC network showed that input from the overconvergent PN types is better discriminated than input from other types. These results suggest an ‘associative fovea’ for olfaction, in that the MB is wired to better discriminate more frequently occurring and ethologically relevant combinations of food-related odors.</p>

      <p>Different types of <i>Drosophila</i> dopaminergic neurons (DANs) reinforce memories of unique valence and provide state-dependent motivational control. Prior studies suggest that the compartment architecture of the mushroom body (MB) is the relevant resolution for distinct DAN functions. Here we used a recent electron microscope volume of the fly brain to reconstruct the fine anatomy of individual DANs within three MB compartments. We find the 20 DANs of the y5 compartment, at least some of which provide reward teaching signals, can be clustered into 5 anatomical subtypes that innervate different regions within y5. Reconstructing 821 upstream neurons reveals input selectivity, supporting the functional relevance of DAN subclassifi-cation. Only one PAM-g5 DAN subtype g5(fb) receives direct recurrent feedback from y5B'2a mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and behavioral experiments distinguish a role for these DANs in memory revaluation from those reinforcing sugar memory. Other DAN subtypes receive major, and potentially reinforcing, inputs from putative gustatory interneurons or lateral horn neurons, which can also relay indirect feedback from MBONs. We similarly reconstructed the single aversively reinforcing PPL1-y1pedc DAN. The y1pedc DAN inputs mostly differ from those of y5 DANs and they cluster onto distinct dendritic branches, presumably separating its established roles in aversive reinforcement and appetitive motivation. Tracing also identified neurons that provide broad input to y5, B'2a, and y1pedc DANs, suggesting that distributed DAN populations can be coordinately regulated. These connectomic and behavioral analyses therefore reveal further complexity of dopaminergic reinforcement circuits between and within MB compartments.</p>

      <p>The hemibrain connectome (Scheffer et al., 2020) provides large scale connectivity and morphology information for the majority of the central brain of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Using this data set, we provide a complete description of the most complex olfactory system studied at synaptic resolution to date, covering all first, second and third-order neurons of the olfactory system associated with the antennal lobe and lateral horn (mushroom body neurons are described in a parallel paper, (Li et al., 2020)). We develop a generally applicable strategy to extract information flow and layered organisation from synaptic resolution connectome graphs, mapping olfactory input to descending interneurons. This identifies a range of motifs including highly lateralised circuits in the antennal lobe and patterns of convergence downstream of the mushroom body and lateral horn. We also leverage a second data set (FAFB, (Zheng et al., 2018)) to provide a first quantitative assessment of inter- versus intra-individual stereotypy. Complete reconstruction of select developmental lineages in two brains (three brain hemispheres) reveals striking similarity in neuronal morphology across brains for >170 cell types. Within and across brains, connectivity correlates with morphology. Notably, neurons of the same morphological type show similar connection variability within one brain as across brains; this property should enable a rigorous quantitative approach to cell typing.</p>
